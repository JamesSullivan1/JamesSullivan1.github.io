### Who I am

I am an information security researcher and student, interested
in the science and art of securing systems. I strongly believe
that a purely attack or defense oriented view of information
security is an incomplete one, and I aim to understand security
from both of these perspectives.  

My academic interests include *Models of security composition*, 
*Cybersecurity Training*, and *Inter-kernel module security*.
My Non-academic interests are in *Reverse Engineering*, *Security
Analysis*, *Linux*, and *Network probing and fingerprinting*. 
I am also an avid practitioner of Karate and enjoy an active 
lifestyle.

* [scapyHunt](https://github.com/JamesSullivan1/scapyHunt) is a series of
    cybersecurity exercises taking place in a 'network' simulated by raw
    packet crafting.
* [jsh](https://github.com/JamesSullivan1/jsh) is a basic shell I wrote.
